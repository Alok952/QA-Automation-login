**# QA-Automation-login**

**About the Project**
This project demonstrates Automated Login Testing for a web application using Selenium WebDriver, Mocha, Chai, and JavaScript. The goal of this project is to automate the login functionality to ensure it behaves correctly for both valid and invalid inputs.

Key Features:
Automated Test Cases: Using Selenium WebDriver to automate the login process on the web application.

Test Framework: Mocha for running the test cases and Chai for assertions to verify expected results.

Login Tests: Includes test cases for:

**Successful login with valid credentials.**

**Error handling for invalid login attempts (e.g., incorrect username or password).**

Cross-Browser Support: Tests are run on different browsers like Chrome and can be configured for others.


**Test Results**


The automated test cases for login have been successfully executed with all tests passing. The following tests are included:

Valid Login Test: Ensures the user can log in with correct credentials and is redirected to the dashboard.

Invalid Login Test: Ensures the correct error message is shown when the user enters incorrect credentials.

Example Results:
**Passed Tests: All test cases passed successfully, confirming that the login functionality works as expected.**

**Failed Tests: If there were any failures, they would be reported with detailed error messages indicating the cause (e.g., incorrect credentials or timeout).**
